# DaysOff

DaysOff was written as course work for Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. The app serves as a wrapper for Google Cloud Api and allows users to schedule events and share those events with friends. For a more detailed look at the concept, see the [implementation guide](https://github.com/amha/Capstone-Project/blob/master/Capstone_Stage1.pdf)
